COGNISENSE AI - TAB 2 - AUDIO ANALYSIS 
==========================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
To test the multimodal capabilities (Audio + Text), navigate to the 
"Microphone Input" section in the application.

Since real clinical audio data is sensitive, use the scripts below 
and follow the "VOCAL CUES" to simulate the biomarkers.

CogniSenseAI will NOT be able to predict these correctly fully, however, these are the correct responses.

The system analyzes three key metrics:
1. Speech Rate (WPM) - Speed of speech.
2. Pitch Variability (F0) - Tonal range (Monotone vs. Expressive).
3. Silence Ratio - Amount of pausing/hesitation.

========================================================================
SCENARIO A: DEPRESSION / FLAT AFFECT (Psychomotor Retardation)
========================================================================
OBJECTIVE: Trigger detection of low energy and monotony.

VOCAL CUES (ACTING INSTRUCTIONS):
- Speak significantly slower than normal.
- Maintain a flat, monotone voice (limit pitch variation).
- Insert long pauses (2-3 seconds) between sentences.
- Low volume/intensity.

[SCRIPT TO READ]
"I just... don't see the point anymore. (Pause)
Everything feels... so heavy. (Pause)
I tried to get out of bed this morning... but I couldn't find a reason to.
(Long Pause)
It's like looking through a gray fog... nothing matters."

[EXPECTED AUDIO METRICS]
>> Speech Rate: LOW (<110 WPM)
>> Pitch Variability: LOW (Flat/Monotone)
>> Silence Ratio: HIGH (>20%)

========================================================================
SCENARIO B: ANXIETY / MANIC AGITATION
========================================================================
OBJECTIVE: Trigger detection of high arousal and pressure of speech.

VOCAL CUES (ACTING INSTRUCTIONS):
- Speak very fast (hurried).
- Breathe shallowly.
- Minimal pauses between sentences.
- Higher pitch, possibly shaky voice.

[SCRIPT TO READ]
"I have to finish the project but I don't have time! If I miss the deadline everything 
will collapse. Did you hear that noise? I think someone is watching me. 
My heart is beating so fast I can't breathe I need to leave right now!"

[EXPECTED AUDIO METRICS]
>> Speech Rate: HIGH (>160 WPM)
>> Pitch Variability: HIGH (Erratic)
>> Silence Ratio: LOW (<10%)

========================================================================
SCENARIO C: CONTROL GROUP (HEALTHY BASELINE)
========================================================================
OBJECTIVE: Verify normal range detection.

VOCAL CUES (ACTING INSTRUCTIONS):
- Normal conversational speed.
- Natural intonation (ups and downs).
- Natural pauses at commas and periods.

[SCRIPT TO READ]
"I had a pretty normal day at work. The traffic was a bit heavy coming home, 
but I listened to a podcast to pass the time. I plan to cook dinner later 
and maybe watch a movie."

[EXPECTED AUDIO METRICS]
>> Speech Rate: NORMAL (130-150 WPM)
>> Pitch Variability: NORMAL (Dynamic)
>> Silence Ratio: BALANCED (10-15%)

FILE UPLOAD TESTING
========================================================================
If you prefer not to use the microphone, you can upload standard .WAV files.
Ensure the files are:
- Mono or Stereo
- Sample rate: 16kHz or 44.1kHz
- Duration: 10-60 seconds for optimal processing.
