COGNISENSE AI - TAB 3: BATCH PROCESSING (RESEARCH MODE)
=========================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
This module allows for the bulk analysis of patient data to generate 
cohort statistics and download aggregate reports.

To test this feature, you need a .CSV file with a specific structure.

STEP 1: PREPARE THE DATA FILE
Create a file named "patient_batch.csv" (or use the content below).
The file MUST have two columns: 'id' and 'text'.
There are 2 example files in the .zip, named Tab3_file1.csv and
Tab3_file2.csv, respectively.
You can choose to make a .csv by yourself with the data provided
below, as well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE CSV CONTENT (Copy and Save as .csv)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
id,text
P001,"I feel a bit tired today but I can manage."
P002,"If I don't get this promotion, my entire career is over."
P003,"He didn't say hello to me, so he definitely hates me."
P004,"I am completely useless at everything I do."
P005,"I feel anxious about the trip, which is normal."
P006,"I felt a pain in my arm, I am surely having a stroke."
P007,"It's all my fault that it rained during the picnic."
P008,"I should never make mistakes, otherwise I am weak."
P009,"I'm sad about the news, but I will recover."
P010,"Nothing good ever happens to me."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: UPLOAD AND PROCESS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to Tab 3 ("Batch Analysis").
2. Drag and drop the "patient_batch.csv" file.
3. Click "Process Batch".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: VERIFY RESULTS (EXPECTED OUTPUT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. STATISTICS:
   - Total Processed: 10
   - Distorted: 6 (60%)
   - Non-Distorted: 4 (40%)

2. VISUALIZATIONS:
   - A Pie Chart showing the distribution of Healthy vs. Distorted.
   - A Bar Chart showing the frequency of specific distortions 
     (e.g., Catastrophizing and Labeling should be prominent).

3. EXPORT:
   - Verify that the "Download Report" button appears.
   - The downloaded CSV should contain a new column: "Predicted_Label".
